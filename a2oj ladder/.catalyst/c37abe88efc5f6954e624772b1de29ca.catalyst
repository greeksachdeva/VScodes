So it is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network. </p><p>But yesterday, he came to see &quot;her&quot; in the real world and found out &quot;she&quot; is actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users&apos; genders by their user names.</p><p>This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one&apos;s user name is odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user by his method.</p>","inSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Input</div><p>The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English letters &#x2014; the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.</p>","outSpecsHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Output</div><p>If it is a female by our hero&apos;s method, print &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">CHAT WITH HER!</span>&quot; (without the quotes), otherwise, print &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">IGNORE HIM!</span>&quot; (without the quotes).</p>","noteHtml":"<div class=\"section-title\">Note</div><p>For the first example. There are 6 distinct characters in &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">wjmzbmr</span>&quot;. These characters are: &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">w</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">j</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">m</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">z</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">b</span>&quot;, &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">r</span>&quot;. So wjmzbmr is a female and you should print &quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">CHAT WITH HER!</span>&quot;.</p>","sampleTestcases":[{"id":1632423476763,"input":"wjmzbmr\n","output":"CHAT WITH HER!\n","result":{"id":1632423476763,"stdout":"CHAT WITH HER!","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":40,"timeout":false}},{"id":1632423476764,"input":"xiaodao\n","output":"IGNORE HIM!\n","result":{"id":1632423476764,"stdout":"IGNORE HIM!","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":39,"timeout":false}},{"id":1632423476765,"input":"sevenkplus\n","output":"CHAT WITH HER!\n","result":{"id":1632423476765,"stdout":"CHAT WITH HER!","stderr":"","exitcode":0,"signal":null,"time":38,"timeout":false}}],"submitUrl":"https://codeforces.com/problemset/submit","language":"c++","langId":"54"}
