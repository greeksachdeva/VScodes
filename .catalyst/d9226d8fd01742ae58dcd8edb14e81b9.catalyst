{"title":"A. Casimir&apos;s String Solitaire","contestId":"1579","problemIndex":"A","timeLimit":"2 seconds","memLimit":"256 megabytes","inputFormat":"standard input","outputFormat":"standard output","problemHtml":"<p>Casimir has a string $$$s$$$ which consists of capital Latin letters &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>&apos;, &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>&apos;, and &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span>&apos; only. Each turn he can choose to do one of the two following actions:</p><ul> <li> he can either erase exactly one letter &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>&apos; <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">and</span> exactly one letter &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>&apos; from arbitrary places of the string (these letters don&apos;t have to be adjacent); </li><li> or he can erase exactly one letter &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>&apos; <span class=\"tex-font-style-bf\">and</span> exactly one letter &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">C</span>&apos; from arbitrary places in the string (these letters don&apos;t have to be adjacent). </li></ul><p>Therefore, each turn the length of the string is decreased exactly by $$$2$$$. All turns are independent so for each turn, Casimir can choose any of two possible actions.</p><p>For example, with $$$s$$$&#xA0;$$$=$$$&#xA0;&quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ABCABC</span>&quot; he can obtain a string $$$s$$$&#xA0;$$$=$$$&#xA0;&quot;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">ACBC</span>&quot; in one turn (by erasing the first occurrence of &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">B</span>&apos; and the second occurrence of &apos;<span class=\"tex-font-style-tt\">A</span>&apos;). There are also many other options for a turn aside from this particular example.</p><p>For a given string $$$s$$$ determine whether there is a sequence of actions leading to an empty string. In other words, Casimir&apos;s goal is to erase all letters from the string.
